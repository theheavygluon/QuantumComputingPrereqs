    "The previous chapter was concluded by describing how one could use a vector to describe a quantum state. This was followed by giving the example of the most basic form of quantum information, a qubit. However, given that a quantum computer's function is to manipulate and evolve a qubit's state according to certain instructions (also called algorithms), it would seem obvious that what we learned isn't sufficient enough to describe quantum information. In quantum mechanics, a system's state is evolved by what is called an operator, and similarly to how vectors are used to describe a system's state, matrices are used to describe how that state evolves once acted upon by an operator. <a href=\"https://www.numpy.org\">Numpy</a> will also be used for Python implementations."

    "As you most likely know, a function is a mathematical object that transforms an input number into an output number. Similarly, an operator is a mathematical object which transforms a function into a whole other function. An example is the derivative, which yields the rate at which a function is changing. The definition of an operator could be extended to vectors. In other word, an operator maps a vector $|v_1>$ to a new vector $|v_2>$. Notationally, this could be written as follows:\n",

This is mainly because in QM, physical quantities which are usually described as functions of time now become linear operators, or more specifically, Hermitian operators. This is what is known as the third postulate of quantum mechanics. For instance, one may have heard of the Schrodinger Equation, which plays a key roll to modeling and understanding quantum systems as it can be solved to obtain the system's wavefunction ($\\psi(x) \\equiv <x|\\psi>$). What one might not know is that it is essentially just an **eigienvector-eigenvalue** relationship of a Hermitian Operator called the Hamiltonian (more on that in chapter 3).\n",

This is extremely crucial because recall that in Section 1.10, we stated that vectors in quantum mechanics and quantum information theory represent amplitudes that when squared, give the probabilities of obtaining a specific state. Meaning that the norm (i.e the sum of all probabilities) must always equal 1, no matter how the statevector evolves. This being given, one should note that any operator which evolves (i.e updates) the statevector should be unitary.\n",
